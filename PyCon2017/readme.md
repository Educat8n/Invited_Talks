# Applying Transfer Learning on Your Data 
Humans have great ability to generalize; we can very efficiently apply the knowledge we learned in classrooms to real world problems. Transfer learning provides a similar capability to artificial neural networks. The Workshop will introduce the concept of 'Transfer Learning' described by Andrew Ng, the leading expert in Machine Learning as the "next driver of ML commercial success." Transfer Learning is important because training deep neural networks from scratch have two key requirements. First, we need a large labeled dataset; the second one requires computationally efficient hardware (GPUs). While such immensely large data exists for some tasks and domains, in most cases the data are usually proprietary or expensive. Transfer Learning, the technique to use models pre-trained on one domain for another problem domain, provides the ability to use DNNs even when the dataset is small. Moreover, Transfer learning requires less computation and thus can be done in respectable time using CPUs as well.

The workshop will cover following topics:

    Introduction to Transfer Learning
